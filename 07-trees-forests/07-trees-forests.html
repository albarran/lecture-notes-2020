# Two-way split of `lstat`

.pull-left[
Let `\(D_i\)` denote an arbitrary two-way "split" dummy variable such that:
`$$D_{i}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
1 &amp; \text{ if } lstat_i &gt; 15\\
0 &amp; \text{ otherwise }, 
\end{array}\right.$$`

On the left, the blue step-function is the fitted value from running
`$$medv_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + \varepsilon_i$$`
Note that the prediction is given by the average of `\(medv_i\)` within each "region".

# Issues

In general using splits involve three main issues:

  1. Where to split?
  2. How many splits?
  3. How to predict within each node?
  
The answers to the these questions are related to the decision trees framework.

# Regression Trees

# Classification and regression trees (CART)

Basic idea (Breiman et al., 1984):

1. Split the features space `\(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{p}\)` - into `\(M\)` distinct and non-overlapping regions (rectangles), `\(R_{1}, R_{2}, \ldots, R_{M}\)`.

2. For every observation that falls into the region `\(R_{j},\)` we make the same prediction (regression or classification). For example, for a continuous `\(y\)`,
`$$\hat{y}_{m}=\frac{1}{N_{m}} \sum_{x_{i} \in R_{m}} y_{i}$$`
where `\(y_m\)` is a test observation that belongs to region `\(R_m\)`.


---
# How to split?

- Going over every possible partitions of the feature space is infeasible. (Why?)

- Instead, the CART algorithm follows a __greedy__ approach.

- Starting with all of the data, consider a splitting variable `\(j\)` and split point `\(s\)`, and define the pair of half-planes
`$$R_{1}(j, s)=\left\{x | x_{j} \leq s\right\}, \qquad R_{2}(j, s)=\left\{x | x_{j}&gt;s\right\}$$`
- find the predictor `\(j^*\)` and split `\(s^*\)` that partitions the data into two regions `\(R_{1}(j^*,s^*)\)` and `\(R_{2}(j^*,s^*)\)` such that the overall sums of squares error are minimized:
`$$\mathrm{RSS}=\sum_{i \in R_{1}(j^*,s^*)}\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}_{1}\right)^{2}+\sum_{i \in R_{2}(j^*,s^*)}\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}_{2}\right)^{2}$$`
where `\(\bar{y}_{1}\)` and `\(\bar{y}_{2}\)` are the averages of the training set outcomes within each group.

---
# The CART Algorithm 

For each node, beginning with the root containing the full sample:

1. Determine the single `\(RSS\)` minimizing split for this node.

2. Split this parent node into the left and right node.

3. Apply steps 1 and 2 to each child node.

4. Continue until you reach a leaf node of some prespecified minimum size (e.g., stop splitting when there are fewer than, say, 10 observations in each leaf).

# How large should we grow the tree?

- Large tree - overfit. Small tree - high variance.

- The tree's level of _expressiveness_ is captured by its size (the number of terminal nodes).

- Common practice: Build a large tree and __prune__ the tree backwards using _cost-complexity pruning_.


---
# Cost-complexity pruning

The cost complexity criterion associated with a tree `\(T\)` is given by

`$$\mathrm{RSS}_{cp}(T)=\mathrm{RSS}(T)+cp|T|$$`
where
  - `\(\mathrm{RSS}\)` is the sum of squared error for tree `\(T\)`.
  - `\(|T|\)` is the number of terminal nodes in tree `\(T\)`.
  - `\(cp\)` is the complexity parameter.
  
Hence, for CART, the penalty is a function of the number of terminal nodes.


__NOTE:__ `\(cp\)` and `\(|T|\)` are analogous to `\(\lambda\)` and `\(\lVert\boldsymbol{\beta}\rVert_1\)` in the lasso.

---
# `\(cp\)`

The complexity parameter is unit free and ranges from 0 to 1:

  - When `\(cp = 0\)`, we have a fully saturated tree.
  
  - When `\(cp = 1\)`, there are no splits, i.e, we predict the unconditional mean.
  

---
# Boston with `\(cp=1\)`

.pull-left[
The R implementation of the CART algorithm is called `{rpart}`. Estimating a tree is straightforward using the `rpart()` function:

```r
tree_fit &lt;- rpart(
  medv ~ lstat,
  data = boston,
* control = rpart.control(cp = 1)
)
```
Recall that setting `\(cp=1\)` enforces no splits.

Plotting a tree is done using the `{rpart.plot}` package

```r
rpart.plot(tree_fit, cex = 2)
```

# Boston with `\(cp=0\)`

.pull-left[

```r
tree_fit &lt;- rpart(
  medv ~ lstat,
  data = boston,
* control = rpart.control(cp = 0, minsplit = 80)
)
rpart.plot(tree_fit, cex = 1)
```
Setting `\(cp=0\)` results in a saturated tree. 

Note we've set the minimum split criterion to `\(80\)` just to avoid clutter (too many splits) in the figure on the right.

# Tuning `\(cp\)`

Breiman et al. (1984) suggest using a cross-validation approach to find the optimal&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; `\(cp\)`:

- For any value of the `\(cp\)` there is a unique, subtree `\(T_{cp}\)` that minimizes cost complexity `\(\mathrm{RSS}_{cp}(T)\)`.

- To find the best subtree, we evaluate the data across a sequence of `\(cp\)` values. This process generates a (finite) sequence of subtrees which contains `\(T_{cp}\)`. 

- Estimation of `\(cp\)` is achieved by cross-validation: we choose the value `\(\hat{cp}\)` that minimizes the cross-validated `\(RSS\)`. Our final tree is `\(T_{\hat{cp}}\)`

.footnote[
[*] Breiman et al. (1984) also propose using the 1se heuristic, i.e., find the smallest tree that is within one standard error of the tree with smallest absolute error.
]


---
# Boston tree cross validation

.pull-left[
The `plotcp()` function from the `{rpart}` package gives a visual representation of the cross-validation results in an `rpart` object:

```r
tree_fit &lt;- rpart(
  medv ~ lstat,
  data = boston
)
*plotcp(tree_fit)
```
`\(cp=0.029\)` is the 1se optimal `\(cp\)`.

]

---
# Boston pruned tree

.pull-left[
We now proceed to pruning the tree using the `prune()` function (also from `{rpart}`), where we set `cp = 0.029`:

```r
*tree_prune &lt;- prune(tree_fit, cp = 0.029)
```

And now we can plot the pruned tree:

```r
rpart.plot(tree_prune, cex = 2)
```

# Trees with multiple features

.pull-left[
How would you partition the data?

```r
boston %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(lstat, rm, color = medv)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8)
```

# `rpart` with many features

.pull-left[

```r
tree_fit &lt;- rpart(
  medv ~ lstat + rm,
  data = boston,
  control = rpart.control(cp = 0.15),
  method = "anova"
)
rpart.plot(tree_fit, cex = 2)
```
For now, we will ignore the `cp = 0.15` argument.

# Variable importance

- Once a tree has been estimated, it is common practice to assess the relative importance of the features to the prediction. 

- A popular measure of variable (feature) importance is the total amount that the `\(RSS\)` is decreased due to splits over a given variable (Breiman et al., 1984.)

- Variables that appear higher or multiple times are more important than variable that appear lower in the tree or less frequently.


---
# Boston variable importance
.pull-left[
We now fit a tree with the entire set of features in the Boston dataset:

```r
tree_all_vars &lt;- rpart(medv ~ ., data = boston)
```

We can easily show variable importance for the fitted tree with the help of the [`{vip}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vip/index.html) package:

```r
vip(tree_all_vars)
```
`rm` (the number of rooms) is clearly the most important feature in predicting `medv`.

# Classification Trees


---
# Adjustment to classification tasks: Splits

- Instead of `\(RSS\)`, splits are typically based on the _Gini index_ (a.k.a _node purity_), defined by
`$$G=\sum_{k=1}^{K} \hat{p}_{m k}\left(1-\hat{p}_{m k}\right),$$`
a measure of total variance across the total classes (this is `rpart`'s default.)

- An alternative to the Gini index is _cross-entropy_, given by
`$$D=-\sum_{k=1}^{K} \hat{p}_{m k} \log \hat{p}_{m k}$$`

---
# Adjustment to classification: Prediction

- Instead of predicting based on the average `\(y\)` in region `\(R_m\)`, prediction is based on a majority rule: each observation belongs to the most commonly occurring class of training observations in the region to which it belongs.

---
# Adjustment to classification: Variable importance

- Variable importance is determined based on the amount that the Gini index/cross-entropy is decreased by splits over a given variable.

# Data details

In this lecture, we will focus on a single outcome and two features:

|  Variable  |  Role        |  Definition  |  Values                   |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|:--------------------------|
|  `survived`|  Outcome     |  Survival    |  0 = No, 1 = Yes          |
|  `age`     |  Feature     |  Age in years|                           |
|  `pclass`  |  Feature     |  Ticket class|  1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd|

Our goal: Predict which passengers survived based on their age and status.

# Trees: pros and cons

Pros:

- Intuitive (more than regression?) 

- Interpretable

- Nonparametric (no bookkeeping)

Cons:

- Overfit

- Poor predictive performance (typically)

---
# Random forests: Basic Idea

- Breiman (2001): Instead of using a single tree, average the predictions of several trees, fitted to bootstrapped training samples + use a subset of the feature space for each split.

- Intuition: Reduce variance (overfit) by averaging multiple noisy and weakly-correlated predictions.

---
# The random forests algorithm

Suppose `\(B\)` is the number of bootstrapped samples, i.e., the number of trees in the forest (typically thousands.)

For `\(b=1 \ldots B\)` :

  1. Sample with-replacement `\(n\)` observations from the data.
  
  2. Grow a tree `\(T_{b}-\)`, where for each split, draw a subset of `\(m\)` features (a common choice is `\(m \approx \sqrt{p}\)`, where `\(p\)` is the dimension of `\(x\)`.)
  
  3. Use typical tree model stopping criteria to determine when a
tree is complete (but do not prune.)


---
# Making predictions

Regression forests:

- For each observation, predict based on the average of `\(B\)` predictions, i.e., 

`$$\hat{f}_{\mathrm{RF}}(x)=\frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} \hat{f}^{* b}(x),$$`
where `\(\hat{f}^{* b}(x)\)` is the prediction based on sample `\(b\)`.

Classification forests:

- For each test observation, record the class predicted by each of the `\(B\)` trees, and take a majority vote.


---
# Out-of-bag error estimation

- Because pf bootstrap, on average, each bagged tree makes use of
around two-thirds of the observations.

- Thus, we can use the remaining on-third observations as "out-of-bag" (OOB) validation set.

- This will yield, on average, `\(B\)` predictions for the `\(i^{\text{th}}\)` observation that belong to the OOB set.

# Fitting forests using `ranger`

Fitting forests in R is easy with the [`{ranger}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ranger/ranger.pdf) package, which uses the same syntax as `{rpart}`.


```r
rf_fit &lt;- ranger(
  formula = medv ~ .,
  data = boston,
  mtry = 3,
  num.trees = 1000,
  importance = "impurity"  
)
```
where

- `num.trees` is the argument for `\(B\)`, the number of trees.
- `mtry` is the argument for `\(m\)`, the number of features drawn before each split.

Note that the `importance` argument will be latter used to construct variable importance measures.


---
# The output of the model

```r
rf_fit
```

```
## Ranger result
## 
## Call:
##  ranger(formula = medv ~ ., data = boston, mtry = 3, num.trees = 1000,      importance = "impurity") 
## 
## Type:                             Regression 
## Number of trees:                  1000 
## Sample size:                      506 
## Number of independent variables:  13 
## Mtry:                             3 
## Target node size:                 5 
## Variable importance mode:         impurity 
## Splitrule:                        variance 
## OOB prediction error (MSE):       10.38274 
## R squared (OOB):                  0.8772533
```

# Variable importance

.pull-left[
The idea is the same as in trees, only now we average the effect of a variable over the `\(B\)` trees.

```r
rf_fit %&gt;% 
  vip()
```
According to our forest, both `lstat` and `rm` outperform the other features.

# Bagging and Boosting

- Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): same as random forest, only `\(m=p\)`. Inferior to random forests since trees are correlated.

- Boosting: This is an example of a _slow learner_ where each tree is grown using information from previously grown trees. (can be estimated using the [`{gbm}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gbm/index.html) package.)


__Note:__ Boosting algorithms in general are very popular and are on the high-end of predictive performance.
